## Employment
***
### Senior Developer - New Technologies Team

**TechnologyOne, QLD  
Jan 2018 - Present**

```
Being a part of the New Technologies team has allowed me to define myself as a leader.
I lead a team of 4 developers, with oversight from a director. I have overseen a project
from inception to a working product and have been crucial in its success. The project has
utilised the ReactJs library using JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS to create an multi SPA
product running both as a web app and a native app using ReactNative. The project has
progressed through both research and development phases utilising the Agile Methodology,
which allowed the team to remain focussed and driven. I ran all stand ups and coordinated
sprint planning as well the workload of junior developers.

The project involved creating an extensive component library of node packages which have
since been used by multiple other internal teams. I created the first SPA app within the
product, which acted as the main portal for accessing other apps. My app consumed many of
the node components through npm as well as some app specific components. I also developed
the back end infrastructure to supply the client with a RESTful API.

I jointly defined the deployment model for the apps client side code. I developed the
deployment infrastructure within TeamCity and AWS where code can progress from being
checked in, to live in production within 2-5 minutes. The deployment stack uses many
AWS resources including CloudFront, ApiGateway and S3. My aim was to remove as much manual
handling within the deployment pipeline as possible. Apart from code check in, the
pipeline has no need for human input to deliver code to the client machine.

The project has required that I upskill in a lot of areas. I have had to manage people,
liaise with many internal teams, provide assistance and training as well as deliver code
of my own. I have stepped well outside my comfort zone because I saw a challenge that would
provide me with a wealth of experience and great learning curve. I have really enjoyed
pushing myself and was reminded why I am so passionate about software development.
```

#### Achievements

```
• Delivering a new product with a new tech stack
• Leading a high performing team
• Developing an automated release pipeline

### Junior >> Senior Developer - Platform Team

**TechnologyOne, QLD  
Jan 2016 - Jan 2018**

```
I worked within the core platform team, delivering feature libraries for internal teams
to utilise.

My role required me to redesign how user access was implemented across the enterprise
suite as well as how functions and their components were provisioned . This required me to
me work with senior developers to map out the schema and entity relationships required to
facilitate efficient set based SQL calls which would then be packaged in an API for all
product teams to utilise. Once the schema was completed I applied OO principles and TDD to
develop the API as well as build up the user interface for system administrators to manage
their users.

My development stack included SQL,PostgreSQL,C#, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. In the
platform team I mainly worked on server side code which is then used by proprietary
patterns to render the client side using the MVC framework. My work has been a combination
of working within these patterns to create new functional screens within the product and
creating new code to be used by the patterns in their operation.
```

#### Achievements

```
• Extensive involvement in the redesign of user access across the whole of the enterprise suite
• Development of a deployment tool used for internal testing and support cases that removes
all need for technical knowledge to get an suite environment up and running

### Junior Developer

**Lifeware, QLD  
July 2015 - Jan 2016**

```
Being a Junior developer at Lifeware allowed me to get involved with the full web stack
across multiple frameworks.

I tackled ground up web builds, Wordpress sites, Shopify sites and many in between.
I worked on existing projects, developing custom analytic tools, load testing and
functionality improvements with a peppering of front end design alterations.

The work was fast paced and dictated by client deadlines. I reported directly to the lead
developer, who structured my workflow and provided me assistance when needed.

### Business Manager

**Gear Shop Brisbane, QLD  
August 2012 - July 2015**

```
This role allowed me to combine my passion for cycling whilst developing and honing many
of my business skills. To successfully manage the business on behalf of the owner, I had
to utilise my skills including financial and staff management, stock control, customer
liaison and most importantly, time management. I combined this role with studying full
time to complete my Information Technology degree which has required me to make sure that
tasks are strictly prioritised and executed to ensure the business’ continual success.
```

#### Achievements

```
• Improving daily cash holdings to ensure the business operates at a sustainable level,
• Implementing a timely management financial reporting process,
• Matching product lines to customer requirements
• Developing a customised ordering system that enables actual costs to be measured in varying
currencies so that the correct sales margins can be applied
• Coordination and development of a website with e-commerce functionality
```

### Genius (Service Technician)

**Apple, Brisbane, QLD  
Feb 2012 - August 2012**

```
As a Genius with Apple, my role was one with a large workflow scope. It required highly
refined personal communication skills, and an advanced technical knowledge of all Apple’s
hardware and software systems. There was a high focus on quality customer service, which
required me to engage the customer but also solve problems quickly and effectively.

I was required to have detailed knowledge on all Apple’s portable devices, desktops and software
packages which was put into practise both dealing with customers and when performing repairs.
The role was fast paced with a strict adherence to personal time management when juggling
the many customer interactions throughout the day.
```

### Group Designer

**The Fox Hotel Group, Brisbane, QLD  
Dec 2010 - Aug 2011**

```
As the Designer for The Fox Hotel Group, I was solely responsible for the design and
branding of the four venues under the group. The position exposed me to many different
facets of design, including web design, web maintenance, print design, billboard design
and logo development.

There was no supervision from a senior designer which necessitated
that I learn on the job through self learning, and problem solving. It also meant that I
became confident liaising with external parties including printers, suppliers, and
function coordinators. I found the position rewarding as it pushed me as a designer and
required me to think outside just one facet of design.
```

### Junior Designer / Financial Manager

**Grand Scheme Clothing, Brisbane, QLD  
Jan 2010 - Dec 2010**

```
Whilst initially being taken on as an intern at Grand Scheme, I stepped into the duties of
a part time designer and financial manager. I had to manage multiple responsibilities all
with short deadlines and with limited guidance. I was required to work independently on
projects within both roles with a high attention paid to detail as my work could not always
be reviewed.

My key achievement was setting up an accounting system with limited resources that was
able to track both payable’s and receivables whilst establishing a reliable figure of
owner’s equity.
```

### Graduate Accountant - Audit / Recovery & Reorganisation

**Grant Thornton, Brisbane, QLD  
Feb 2009 - Aug 2009**

```
On graduating from Queensland University of Technology, I actively pursued a career as an
accounting graduate with the global accounting group Grant Thornton. In my role as a
graduate accountant, I worked within the Audit and Insolvency departments.

Working within both these departments enabled me to interact directly with clients on a
daily basis, gain a thorough understanding of business procedures and refine my skills in
communication and time management. Whilst working in the Insolvency department I was a
principal contact with a major client and entrusted with substantial responsibilities
in this role.
